## 📖 Definition

The **100 Continue** status code means the server has **received the request headers** and the client should **proceed to send the request body**.

It’s used when the client wants to **check if the server is ready** before sending a large payload (like a big file upload).

> 🧠 **In short:** The server is saying — “✅ Got your headers, go ahead and send the rest!”

---

## ⚙️ Typical Scenario

1. 🧍 The client sends a request with the header `Expect: 100-continue`.  
2. 🖥️ The server replies with `HTTP/1.1 100 Continue` — meaning it’s okay to continue.  
3. 📦 The client then sends the request body (e.g., a file or form data).

## 💻 Example Request & Response

**Client Request:**

```http
POST /api/upload HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 10240
Expect: 100-continue
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Server Response:**

```http
HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
```

➡️ Then the client sends the rest of the body:

```http
{
  "fileName": "profile-picture.png",
  "fileSize": "10MB"
}
```

Finally, after successful upload:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
```

## 🍔 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you’re at a restaurant:

- You: “Can I place a big order?” 🍔

- Waiter: “Sure, go ahead!” ✅
   That “Sure, go ahead!” is your 100 Continue — permission to proceed.

## ⚠️ Developer Tips

- Always use Expect: 100-continue when sending large requests.

- Some servers automatically handle it, others may skip this step.

- If you never send large payloads, you might never see this code.
